# Password Generator Starter Code

I created a password generator that promps pop ups for different options that a person can choose for their password. The password is then generated after the options are chosen.

- I created variables for each alphabetical, numerical, and specialty character, including variables for capitalized and lowercase letters.
- I created else, else if, and if codes to create the prompts that pop up for the user to choose which options they would like for their code.
- I edited the button and text colors in the css code.
